/*

For the explanation, I will use the notation that 1r = row 1 of the railway graph.

The train starts at 3r -> 4r.

The row order will be as follows:

3r -> 4r
4r -> 4r
4r -> 3r
3r -> 2r
2r -> 1r
1r -> 1r
1r -> 2r
2r -> 3r

Because 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 can be divided by 8, and the length of this train journey is 8, we can say that the train will end up at 3r -> 4r, the row the train started from.
