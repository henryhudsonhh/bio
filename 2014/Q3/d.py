# Scores 5/5 | 100%

# One pair:
# - ABUVWXYZ0123456789
# - BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS

# Both must be 18 (36 / 2) characters long
# Because if one password has one more character that the other, there must be 37 total characters used, which is more than 36.
# First password must start with an A because all characters are used, and the passwords are ordered.
# First password must be the final password starting with A of length 18 (must end with a 9 as well).
# That last password is ABUVWXYZ0123456789 (first password)
# The unused characteres, in order, are: BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS (second password)
